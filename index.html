<p><h2> Early Austin Life:</h2>

 Since his move from Lubbock to Austin , TX , Sunny Fairly has tried to surround himself with the live music scene that saturates his new hometown. He's been hosting a songwriter showcase for several years, which has only made for further inspiration to follow his dream of being a touring musician. It also happens to be the reason he met Larry Graves, of New Austin Music Studios. Sunny will never forget the first time he was able to record, which set him on his way to live that dream!<p>

<p>Sunny Fairly has music on the internet! WHAT?! Maybe he'll be famous someday, and that would be hella sweet!!!</p>

<p>Honestly humbled dude. I pretend that I'm a real musician from time to time, and I keep the aspirations of being one someday. I love to play music almost as much as I love hearing it, and I like it even better when it's live and brand spankin new! That's why I hosted the Austin Songwriter Showcase at a place called Trophy's Bar & Grill in Austin, TX. Austin being the 'Live music capital of the world' pretty much insured that I'm was able to hear new original music every week, LIVE! I love that town.

Austin is such an amazing town, and has been the platform for me to realize my own potential as a human being. There are so many amazing people there, and we are all about to change the world to make it a better place!!

Recently, my girlfriend Danielle and I, moved to San Marcos, TX. Life has treated me pretty well, I must say.

Look for my CD that should be coming out soon...I just have to make it, and it'll be ready to go!</p>
