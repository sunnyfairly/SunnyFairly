<p><h2> Early Austin Life:</h2>

 Since his move from Lubbock to Austin , TX , Sunny Fairly has tried to surround himself with the live music scene that saturates his new hometown. He's been hosting a songwriter showcase for several years, which has only made for further inspiration to follow his dream of being a touring musician. It also happens to be the reason he met Larry Graves, of New Austin Music Studios. Sunny will never forget the first time he was able to record, which set him on his way to live that dream!<p>

<p>Sunny Fairly has music on the internet! WHAT?! Maybe he'll be famous someday, and that would be hella sweet!!!</p>
