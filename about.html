  <p><h2> Early Austin Life:</h2>

   Since his move from Lubbock to Austin , TX , Sunny Fairly has tried to surround himself with the live music scene that saturates his new hometown. He's been hosting a songwriter showcase for several years, which has only made for further inspiration to follow his dream of being a touring musician. It also happens to be the reason he met Larry Graves, of New Austin Music Studios. Sunny will never forget the first time he was able to record, which set him on his way to live that dream!<p>

  <p>Honestly humbled dude. I pretend that I'm a real musician from time to time, and I keep the aspirations of being one someday. I love to play music almost as much as I love hearing it, and I like it even better when it's live and brand spankin new! That's why I hosted the Austin Songwriter Showcase at a place called Trophy's Bar & Grill in Austin, TX. Austin being the 'Live music capital of the world' pretty much insured that I'm was able to hear new original music every week, LIVE! I love that town.

  Austin is such an amazing town, and has been the platform for me to realize my own potential as a human being. There are so many amazing people there, and we are all about to change the world to make it a better place!!

  Recently, my girlfriend Danielle and I, moved to San Marcos, TX. Life has treated me pretty well, I must say.

  Look for my CD that should be coming out soon...I just have to make it, and it'll be ready to go!</p>

  <p>The magi, as you know, were wise men--wonderfully wise men--who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. O all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.   - O. Henry, The Gift of the Magi </p>

  <p>Live as if you were to die tomorrow; learn as if you were to live forever.</p>
  <p>Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.</p>
  <p>An eye for eye only ends up making the whole world blind.</p>
  <p>You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.</p>
  <p>Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.</p>
  <p>A man is but the product of his thoughts; what he thinks, he becomes.</p>
  <P>The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.</P>
  <p>First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.</p>
